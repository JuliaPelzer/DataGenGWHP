# This is the default use case. All the default values except the output_directory come from the defaults defined by the
# program. It provides a small domain (32, 256, 1) with a resolution of (5, 5, 5) meters per cell. There is a fixed
# temperature, pressure gradient and permeability and a single heat pump with a fix position.
#
# grid: 2D unstructured (converted to 3D with z = 1) -> (32, 256, 1)
# datapoint(s): 1
# heat pump(s): 1 fix
# permeability: fix
# pressure gradient: fix
# temperature: fix

general:
  output_directory: ./datasets_out/case0_default
  # TODO remove this
