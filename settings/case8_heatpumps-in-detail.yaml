# This setting has six hps which show the different possibilities to specify operational parameters.
# - hp1: fixed values
# - hp2: calculates different values for each of the datapoints
# - hp3: time based values for the injection_temp
# - hp4: time based values varying between min and max values
# - hps: generates two heatpumps which also support the four modes from hp1-4
