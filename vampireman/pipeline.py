"""
This is the pipeline that executes the seven stages of vampireman in their order.
The stages are:

1. `vampireman.loading_stage.loading_stage.loading_stage`
1. `vampireman.preparation_stage.preparation_stage.preparation_stage`
1. `vampireman.validation_stage.validation_stage.validation_stage`
1. `vampireman.variation_stage.variation_stage.variation_stage`
1. `vampireman.render_stage.render_stage`
1. `vampireman.simulation_stage.simulation_stage`
1. `vampireman.visualization_stage.visualization_stage`

When running interactively (depending on `vampireman.data_structures.GeneralConfig.interactive`), the execution flow
will be interrupted after the `validation_stage` and after printing the resulting `State` object, asking the user if the
pipeline should continue. If the user denies, vampireman will exit.
